# Lee's Projects

This repo contains my materials for building a software focusing on English learning. You can fork or download demo in `/code`

## Contribution

Feel free to discuss and help improve the notes by submitting an issue. I'll look into it and update my notes. I hope that my materials would contribute to your academic well-being in these courses.

I'm grateful to every one who wants to contribute. However, I decided not to accept pull requests at this time. Just open an issue and I'll fix it.

If you want, you may request a copy of org-mode source code by sending email to me.

## Tips

**Commit Policy** I'll only retain the latest commit of this repo. Therefore, you won't be able to browse history. But I'll state what changes I've made each time in CHANGELOG.md. This repo will be updated in-time during the process of the class taken.

**Base on React** Most of the project frontend structures are written with [React](https://reactnative.dev/). If you want to build your own App, I recommend that for you.

**Node.js required** You may need to learn a little about [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. You may also contribute or write a issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/edit/main/locale/en/index.md). Feel free!

**Expo is wonderful** I highly recommend you to build your project with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/), Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase. If you are already experienced with React and JavaScript tooling and want to dive right in and figure things out as you go, this is the quickest way to get started:

```shell
# install the command line tools
$ npm install --global expo-cli
# Create a new project
$ expo init my-project
```

Expo can help you view your process simply when building an App.

**Academic Integrity** I may attach some source code to better illustrate the ideas in notes. If you want to use these code snippets in your course work or course projects, you should cite the source clearly.
